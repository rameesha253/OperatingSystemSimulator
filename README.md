# OperatingSystemSimulator
The OS Simulator showcases core OS concepts like multitasking, resource allocation, and user/kernel modes. It runs 15+ tasks (e.g., notepad, calculator) as separate processes using EXEC, semaphores, and multilevel queues. It simulates boot, scheduling, interrupts, and file saving to demonstrate OS functionality.
